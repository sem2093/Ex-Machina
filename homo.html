		<h2>Education/Experience</h2>
		<p>I graduated highschool in 2012 from Alta high school in Sandy Ut. After highschool I went to Brigham You
G University where I would first begin programming. I took a Computer Science course which introduced me to the world of computer programming. I have yet to obtain a college degree but my passion for learning and curiosity has helped me continue learning even though Im not enrolled in school any longer. </p>
