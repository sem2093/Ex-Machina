		<h2> Chat GPT</h2>

		<details><p> 
ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI. It is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, specifically GPT-3.5. It is designed to generate human-like text responses and engage in conversational interactions with users.
ChatGPT is trained on a vast amount of diverse text data, allowing it to understand and generate coherent responses in natural language. It leverages deep learning techniques, specifically transformers, to process and generate text.
The model can be used in a variety of applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, customer support systems, and more. It can understand and generate responses to questions, provide explanations, offer suggestions, and engage in interactive conversations.
It's important to note that ChatGPT, like other language models, generates responses based on patterns and information in its training data. While it can provide helpful information, it may also occasionally produce incorrect or nonsensical answers. It's always a good practice to critically evaluate the generated responses and verify information from reliable sources when needed. To try out Chat GPT visit resources page.

<h2> Auto-GPT </h2>
<details><p>
Auto-GPT is an "AI agent" that given a goal in natural language, will attempt to achieve it by breaking it into sub-tasks and using the internet and other tools in an automatic loop. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 APIs, and is among the first examples of an application using GPT-4 to perform autonomous tasks.

<h2>Education & Experience</h2>
		<p>I graduated high school in 2012 from Alta High School in Sandy, UT. After high school, I went to Brigham Young University, where I first began programming. I took a computer science course, which introduced me to the world of computer programming. Although I have not yet obtained a college degree, my passion for learning and curiosity has helped me continue learning even though I'm not enrolled in school any longer.Ive held many jobs such as customer service representative, fire alarm and security technician, and sea food processor. As for professional licenses I held a Master Fire Alarm Technician license in the state of Utah. I hope to one day secure a job in the tech industry. For the time being I will aim to become a professional coder and hence will further my skills in that direction. <p>
