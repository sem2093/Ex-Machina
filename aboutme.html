		<h2>Education/Experience</h2>
		<p>I graduated high school in 2012 from Alta High School in Sandy, UT. After high school, I went to Brigham Young University, where I first began programming. I took a computer science course, which introduced me to the world of computer programming. Although I have not yet obtained a college degree, my passion for learning and curiosity has helped me continue learning even though I'm not enrolled in school any longer. </p>
